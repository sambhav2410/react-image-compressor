We often need to decrease the file size for our images as the files with larger size take a lot of time to get load and it becomes really difficult so here we use file compressors. Now Allcompressimage.com does it in a very easy and user-friendly way. The process to reduce the size of your PNG file is that you just have to open Allcompressimage.com in your browser in mobile or PC.

Image Compression is a kind of Compression approaches that lessen the size of an image without any loss of information as well as without downgrading its quality.In simple words, the technique of reducing data of image by which it is represented without loss of any information. It applies to digital images so that reasonable cost is incurred on storage and transmogrification of data.For Example:- Any video of 2GB which is of  2 hours before compression but after that, the video is of 980MB but time will remain the same because there will be no effect on the information.Image Compression can be split into 2 categories i.e\tLossy Compression ,\tLossless Compression.',\n    open: false\n  }, {\n    question: 'Q3.

Lossless compression is usually done for medical and legal documents and computer programs whereas lossy compression is carried out for videos and digital images where only a few errors pop up.In lossless compression, just like the term ‘lossless’, there is no loss or no decrease to the quality of the image, only the size is reduced. But lossy compression permanently clears out the data.There are different types of compressed image files, some of them are PNG, JPEG and GIF.PNG is the abbreviation for Portable Network Graphics. It comes under a lossless compression type. The quality o the file when converted to PNG is very high. PNG is often used when the image contains layers of graphics that to be separated from each other.JPEG is usually used for digital camera images, as the file size is smaller. JPEG comes under lossy compression type, which means it can compress the file more than the PNG.GIF is usually used to store simple animated images.
